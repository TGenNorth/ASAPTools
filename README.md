# ASAPTools
ASAPTools is a combination of tools to allow further analysis of sequence data analyzed with TGen North's Amplicon Sequencing Pipeline (ASAP) (https://github.com/TGenNorth/ASAP). The functions within this package, generally, parse different datatypes from the ASAP xml file produced from "analyzeAmplicons."

Please note that this is an early and active version of the package, and results should be verified by the user.
