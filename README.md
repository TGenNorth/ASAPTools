# ASAPTools
ASAPTools is a combination of tools to allow further analysis of sequence data analyzed with TGen North's Amplicon Sequencing Pipeline (ASAP) (https://github.com/TGenNorth/ASAP). The functions within this package, generally, parse different datatypes from the ASAP xml file produced from "analyzeAmplicons."
